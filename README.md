## Problem Statement
The advent of quick commerce has made ordering food easier than ever, leading to a decline in home cooking—especially of traditional, indigenous recipes that may disappear with our grandmothers’ generation. At the same time, people are becoming more health-conscious and budget-aware. What better way to address both than by suggesting recipes that make the most of what’s already in your fridge—while guiding you through your (or someone else’s) grandma’s special recipe?


## Solution
We aim to build a smart recipe assistant that can:
   * Suggest recipes using images of their fridge's contents.

   * Preserve indigenous recipes by recommending regional, lesser-known dishes within user groups with similar "tastes" (pun intended).

   * Guide users step-by-step through cooking via an interactive chatbot.

## Tech Stack
    * Streamlit
    * Python


## Business Scope
    * Can boost 

## To-do
   * Add dairy recipes

## Notes
Rule-based recommendation engine doesn't FILTER recipes, it suggests recipes close to your preference, with ingredients that you have.
